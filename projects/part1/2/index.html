      Working dogs are specially trained animals that perform important jobs alongside humans. They guide people who are visually impaired, herd livestock on farms, search for survivors in disasters, and even work with police and military units. Unlike pets, their daily lives are built around focus, discipline, and teamwork, showing how deeply connected humans and dogs can be.
